;;; Commentary:

;; To espy is to see something at a distance which is what this package is about.
;; This package allows users to fetch a password from a file without visiting
;; it. It gathers all headers containing passwords defined by
;; `espy-header-prefix' and `espy-password-prefix' and presents them to the user.
;; The choosen password gets added to the kill ring.
;;
;; For example using a password file with the content of
;; (with no whitespace before any prefix)
;;
;;    *** Header1
;;    >> Password1
;;
;; and running
;;
;;    (espy)
;;
;; would result in one entry `Header1' being selectable. Choosing this entry
;; results in `Password1' being copied to the kill-ring

;;; Code:

(defvar espy-password-file "~/password.org.gpg"
  "The file to pull passwords from.")

(defvar espy-header-prefix "*"
  "A single letter string prefixing password headings.

Expected to be repeated 1 or more times before a
whitespace followed by a password in password file.")

(defvar espy-password-prefix ">>"
  "A string prefixing passwords.")

(defun espy-get-password-headers ()
  "Fetches all headers containing a password in a file."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents espy-password-file)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    ;; Search for user selected header
    (let* ((found-headers (list)))
      (while
	  (ignore-errors
	    ;; Go to next header in case last header had more than 1 password
	    (re-search-forward (concat "^" espy-header-prefix "+\s"))
	    (re-search-forward (concat "^" espy-password-prefix))
	    (re-search-backward (concat "^" espy-header-prefix "+\s"))
	    ;; Search-backward puts the cursor at column position 0, fix this
	    (re-search-forward "\s"))
	;; Push header string to list
	(push (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (line-end-position)) found-headers))
      found-headers)))
