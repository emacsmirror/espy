* Espy - Emacs Simple Password Yielder
To espy is to see something at a distance which is what this package is about. This package allows users to fetch a password from a file without visiting it.

** This solution compared to other password solutions (pass, keepass, etc)
- Only dependent on GPG
- Password file can be opened and edited using only GPG and a text editor
- Easily change format of password file to fit your favorite major mode.
- Org mode
- Support for both symmetric encryption (not supported by pass) and asymmetric encryption (not officially supported by keepass)

** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'espy)
#+END_SRC

** Usage
First select the directory of your password file by changing =espy-password-file= e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq espy-password-file "~/my-passwords.org.gpg")
#+END_SRC

Then type =M-x espy= to select which password you want to copy to the killring.

Keep in mind that the password will stay in the killring event after being pasted, to fix this you could bind =(pop kill-ring)= which yanks the latest entry in the killring and then removes it from the killring.

This package is kept deliberately short to allow for easy manual checks as to minimize the "hijacked account" attack vector and should ideally be stored offline, without automatic updates.

** Configuration
What format =M-x espy= expects can be modified by changing =espy-header-prefix= and =espy-password-prefix=. By default it expects org headings ("*") followed by a password (">>").
